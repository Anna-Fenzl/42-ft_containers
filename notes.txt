==> check the code again, make it cleaner if possible
==> run testers, like unitest(2 segfault on default)

VECTOR:
DOESNT COMPILE

STACK:
fine âœ“

MAP:
compare class failed
timeout lower bound && upper_bound
using allocator failed
> && <= operator failed

SET:
compare class failed
timeout lower bound && upper_bound
using allocator failed
> && <= operator failed
--> (same thing)


---------------- DONE ---------------
==> make set( basically map )
==> compare output to original map
==> check out the const problem again, maybe operator overloads are not complete
==> print shouldnt be public -> different tests
==> also tree should be hidden in map
	ie. size.begin().base().
