	iterator
		end () throw()	{ return iterator(_end); }

==> check the code again, make it cleaner if possible
==> run testers, like unitest(2 segfault on default)
==> make set( basically map )

---------------- DONE ---------------
==> compare output to original map
==> check out the const problem again, maybe operator overloads are not complete
==> print shouldnt be public -> different tests
==> also tree should be hidden in map
	ie. size.begin().base().
