==> print shouldnt be public -> different tests
==> check the code again, make it cleaner if possible
==> check out the const problem again, maybe opertor overloads are not complete
==> compare output to original map
==> run testers, like unitest(2 segfault on default)

==> make set( basically map )



---------------- DONE ---------------
==> also tree should be hidden in map
